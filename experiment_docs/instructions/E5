# How to run experiments?

[Experiment1: tail-call kfuse-retpoline]
In the paper, we run Step3 50 times and calculate the average. 

# Step1: Launch VM
./launch_vm.sh 5

# Step2: (In VM)
cd /root/tail-call-benchmark/

# Step3: Run experiments
./benchmark_tail_call.sh 32 10000


[Experiment2: tail-call nokfuse-retpoline (direct jump)]
In the paper, we run Step3 50 times and calculate the average.

# Step1: Launch VM
./launch_vm.sh 2

# Step2: (In VM)
cd /root/tail-call-benchmark/

# Step3: Run experiments
./run.sh 32 10000


[Experiment3: tail-call nokfuse-retpoline (indirect jump)]
In the paper, we run Step3 50 times and calculate the average.

# Step1: Launch VM
./launch_vm.sh 6

# Step2: (In VM)
cd /root/tail-call-benchmark/

# Step3: Run experiments
./run.sh 32 10000


[Note]
Your experiment results may differ from ours due to different environment.
However, the relationship between these 3 experiments should be the same.
