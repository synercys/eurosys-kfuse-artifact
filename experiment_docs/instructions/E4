# How to run experiments?

[Experiment: cgroup + iPerf]

# Step1: Launch VM ($num = 1,2,3,4)
#
# $num = 1 => kfuse-retpoline
# $num = 2 => nokfuse-retpoline
# $num = 3 => kfuse-noretpoline
# $num = 4 => nokfuse-noretpoline
cp fs/rootfs.ext4 .
./launch_vm.sh $num 

# Step2: (In VM) ($nfilter = 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160 => how many filters attach to the cgroup?)
cd root
./cgroup_simple_benchmark $nfilter > log &

# restart VM between iterations => (Ctrl + A) + X => Similar to FAQ Q7

# Step3: (In VM) Use iPerf3 to measure TCP bandwidth
#        Check the following command output or the file `log` 
iperf3 -c 172.16.2.2 -t 30 -P 16 -l 32K


[Note]
You may need to run multiple times to get the average result.
In addition, if your result is unstable, you can pin your tasks on idle CPUs, and fix their frequency.
We expected that the kernel with KFuse will be faster than without KFuse (Speed: kfuse-retpoline > nokfuse-retpoline; kfuse-noretpoline > nokfuse-noretpoline), 
and without retpoline will be faster than with retpoline (Speed: kfuse-noretpoline > kfuse-retpoline; nokfuse-noretpoline > nokfuse-retpoline).
