# How to run experiments?

[Experiment: redis with systemd]

# Step0: SSH setup (optional)
# If you cannot use ssh to access this VM, you can follow this step.
# (1) Generate a public key (ex: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) in your local machine
# (2) Copy the public key to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`
# (3) Now you can use ssh to access the VM without password


# Step1: Run experiment 
./scripts/bench_merger.sh redis-real

# Step5: see result
cat bpf_microbench.result


[Note]
1. The result will be stored in bpf_microbench.result with the foramt 'redis-real, #of filter, vm_type, throughput, stderr'
   And our goal is to demonstrate that with KFuse open, we have greater redis throughtput. 
2. We expected to see that mergers have greater throughtput. 
3. This experiment corresponds to part 5.1.1 of the paper, E1 of the artifact appendix.
4. Due to the long running time, we reduce # of iteration.
5. if your results are different from the expected reusts due to different environment, please focus on the relative relationship.
