# How to run experiments?

[Experiment: redis with systemd]

# Step0: SSH setup (optional)
# If you cannot use ssh to access this VM, you can follow this step.
# (1) Generate a public key (ex: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub) in your local machine
# (2) Copy the public key to `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`
# (3) Now you can use ssh to access the VM without password


# Step1: Run experiment 
./scripts/bench_merger.sh redis-real

# Step5: see result
cat bpf_microbench.result

[Note]
Due to the long running time, we reduce # of iteration.
In addition, if your results are different from the expected reusts due to different environment, please focus on the relative relationship.
